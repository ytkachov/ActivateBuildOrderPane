# ActivateBuildOrderPane

This trivial VS extension activates Build Order Pane of the Output Window as soon as Build completed. Automatic 
switching to the Build Order pane does not make much sense for solutions with one project but for 
multiple-projects solution could be quite convenient. Once the extension is installed you will see 
one more button on the Output Window toolbar. To switch on the automatic activation of the Build 
Order pane this button must be in "checked" (or pressed) state.
